This is a combined resource of 5 publications that looked at human imprinting:

|Publication| Tissue-specificity|
|---|---|
| Court et al. 2014| Placental + Other|
| Hanna et al. 2016| Placental + Other|
| Sanchez-Delgado et al. 2016| Placental|
| Hamada et al. 2016| Placental|
| Zink et al. 2018| Other|

These regions can be found in @ `processed/all_imprinted_dmrs.tsv`

Here is a view of the first 6 rows:

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(inspectdf)
library(kableExtra)
dmrs <- read_tsv(here::here('processed', 'all_imprinted_dmrs.tsv'))
head(dmrs) %>% kable() 
```

There are in total 418 imprinted regions, which can be divided into those that are specific to the placenta, and those that have been observed in other tissues.

```{r}
dmrs %>%
  count(tissue_specificity)
```
